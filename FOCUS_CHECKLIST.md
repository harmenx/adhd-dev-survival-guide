# Focus Checklist (ADHD Developers)

> A zero-thinking checklist to enter, maintain, and exit focused work.  
> Use this every time you start coding.

---

## Before You Start (2 minutes)

Do not start until all are checked.

- [ ] One task defined in one sentence
- [ ] “Definition of Done” written
- [ ] Timer set (25 or 45 minutes)
- [ ] Phone out of reach
- [ ] Notifications off
- [ ] Only IDE + terminal open

If any box is unchecked, fix it first.

---

## During Focus Block

Rules you must follow:

- [ ] Work on **one task only**
- [ ] One file or problem at a time
- [ ] No browsing unless directly required
- [ ] No rewriting code unless necessary

### If a Distraction Appears

- [ ] Write the thought down
- [ ] Do **not** act on it
- [ ] Return to task immediately

Distractions are deferred, not solved.

---

## Mid-Block Reality Check (Optional)

If you feel stuck or restless:

- [ ] Reduce scope by 50%
- [ ] Ask: “What is the next 5-minute action?”
- [ ] Continue until timer ends

Do not quit mid-timer unless absolutely necessary.

---

## After the Timer Ends

Stop immediately.

- [ ] Stand up
- [ ] Move body for 1–2 minutes
- [ ] Drink water
- [ ] Decide: another block or stop

Never chain blocks while exhausted.

---

## End of Session Checklist

Before closing your IDE:

- [ ] Commit changes or write notes
- [ ] Write the exact next step
- [ ] Close all work-related apps
