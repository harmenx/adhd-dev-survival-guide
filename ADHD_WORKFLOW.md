# ADHD Developer Workflow

> A practical, repeatable workflow designed to help developers with ADHD focus, ship code, and avoid burnout.  
> This is not motivational. It is operational.

## Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **One task at a time**
   - If it doesn’t fit in one sentence, it’s not a task.
2. **Start before you feel ready**
   - Momentum beats motivation.
3. **Reduce choices**
   - Fewer tools, fewer tabs, fewer decisions.
4. **Always define “done”**
   - Vague tasks cause paralysis.

## Daily Structure

### 1. Morning (Planning: 10–15 min)

Goal: Decide *what matters today*.

- Pick **1 primary task** (must ship today)
- Pick **1 secondary task** (nice-to-have)
- Everything else goes to a backlog
