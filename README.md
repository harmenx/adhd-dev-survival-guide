## ⏱ Focus & Time Management

- **Pomodoro Technique** – 25min focus + 5min break.  
- **Time blocking** – Schedule “deep work” periods.  
- **Forest / Focusmate** – Gamified focus sessions.  
- **Use multiple monitors minimally** – Avoid visual overwhelm.  
- **Break tasks into micro-tasks** – 10–30 min chunks.

## 💡 Coding Workflows for ADHD

1. **Start with a clear outcome** – Avoid vague tasks.  
2. **Automate repetitive tasks** – Scripts, Git hooks, templates.  
3. **Use linters & formatters** – Reduces mental overhead.  
4. **Pair programming** – Helps maintain focus & accountability.  
5. **Track your energy, not just time** – Work when most alert.

## 🔥 Boost Motivation

- Reward small wins: commit streaks, build checklists.  
- Use gamified coding platforms: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).  
- Rotate tasks to prevent boredom.  

---

## 📚 Learning & Memory Hacks

- Use **spaced repetition** (Anki, Obsidian plugins) for new concepts.  
- Take notes in **visual formats**: diagrams, flowcharts, mind maps.  
- Summarize docs in your own words to reinforce understanding.

## 🛠 Automation & Scripts

- Automate repetitive Git commands using aliases:  
```bash
git co main
git st
git cm "message"
